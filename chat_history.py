      Had an amazing time at the Grafana and Friends Meetup in Chennai, where I attended a standout session by MANOJKUMAR G, an SRE from IBM. His insights on how IBM tackles observability challenges using Grafana and AI were truly eye-opening

      From missing logs in centralized systems to alert fatigue, Manojkumar shared practical solutions IBM has implemented to keep their systems running smoothly. It was fascinating to see how they're leveraging AI and unified dashboards to streamline diagnostics and reduce noise in alerts.

      This session has definitely deepened my interest in observability, and I'm excited to explore more advanced tools like the #LGTM stack and Cribl in the coming weeks.

      If you're curious about how IBM is pushing the boundaries of system monitoring, I've shared a detailed blog with all the insights.

      üöÄ Exciting Announcement guys, a Data Engineering task conquered! üéâ

      I've successfully completed a challenging data engineering task ü§ò , and here's what it entailed:
      - To collect movie details starting with the letters 'S' and 'H' from at least two websites.
      - Leveraged any language of choice to scrape data from diverse sources like Wikipedia, IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes.
      - Utilized middle layer APIs found on the web for streamlined data retrieval.

      üõ†Ô∏è After crafting a schema tailored to store relevant movie details in a database of choice, I ensured scalability by populating the datastore with over 10,000 records.

      ‚ú® Data Pipeline Creation: Employed the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Python.
      - Extracted data seamlessly from the TMDB Movie API.
      - Transformed and enriched the data to suit the database schema.
      - Loaded the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database, meticulously designed by yours truly.

      üåê I also developed the Met-Movie-API, a Python Flask service that allows users to access all the enriched movie data stored in the PostgreSQL database. The seamless integration enables users to interact with the database effortlessly.


      üìö Throughout this journey, I've acquired valuable skills. I mastered the ETL model, gained expertise in creating APIs using Flask for seamless data access, implemented multiprocessing techniques in Python for enhanced performance, and containerized the entire application for easy deployment and scalability using Docker.

      üíº I'm thrilled to invite you to explore the project on GitHub and contribute your insights and expertise.
      Let's collaborate and innovate together!
