      "🌟 Excited to share my incredible journey as the General Secretary of SAAS CEG (Student Association of Arts Society) at College of Engineering, Guindy , Anna University Chennai 🌟 /n  /n Last August, I embarked on this adventure by campaigning for elections with my fellow participants. For nearly 2 months, we campaigned tirelessly, spoke with class representatives, expressed our dedication, and earned their hopes. 🤝✨ The election day was a pivotal moment, and I proudly became part of the Student Association of CEG. 🎉 /n  /n After the election, we focused on addressing student queries and collaborating with management to resolve them. Soon, the members of the Arts Society were selected by the student advisor and dean, forming a team of 25 members across 9 domains. Our first major task was organizing the odd semester cultural fest, Utopia. 🎭 /n  /n Utopia took place within a week of forming the Arts Society, spanning 3 days and featuring 25+ events, a movie night , stage performances, a DJ, and a music concert. On the first day, we were felicitated as members of SAAS CEG by our  Dean CEG Campus Dr. L Suganthi and Student Advisor CEG Campus Dr. Swaminathan . This was my first event, and I wholeheartedly contributed to its success. 🎶 /n  /n Next, we organized open calls for volunteers from various years. We started with the 3rd years, then the 2nd years, and finally welcomed the 1st years to SAAS. Each open call had its challenges, but we learned from our mistakes and improved each time. The last open call was our biggest success, with overwhelming support from the 1st years. 🚀 /n  /n Our next major goal was organizing the grand college cultural fest, Techofes🎭. Seeking sponsors was initially tough, with many rejections, but we persevered and secured the necessary sponsorships. I involved myself in all domains, mainly focusing on Marketing, Technical Design, Human Resources, Events, and Corporate Relations. 💼 /n  /n Techofes was packed with events, prize money, movie nights, DJ nights, T-awards, music concerts, T-rides, food stalls, sponsor stalls, workshops, and many more fun activities ✨.  /n  /n 🌟During the four days of Techofes, I worked with all domain office bearers 💼, helped with various tasks, and gave my best. I learned a lot, made tough decisions, faced challenging situations, and enjoyed every moment. 🎊🎶 /n  /n #Leadership #StudentLife #CEG #AnnaUniversity #SAAS #Teamwork #Dedication #Utopia #Techofes"
