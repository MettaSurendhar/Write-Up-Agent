      "🌟 Excited to share my incredible journey as the General Secretary of SAAS CEG (Student Association of Arts Society) at College of Engineering, Guindy , Anna University Chennai 🌟 /n  /n Last August, I embarked on this adventure by campaigning for elections with my fellow participants. For nearly 2 months, we campaigned tirelessly, spoke with class representatives, expressed our dedication, and earned their hopes. 🤝✨ The election day was a pivotal moment, and I proudly became part of the Student Association of CEG. 🎉 /n  /n After the election, we focused on addressing student queries and collaborating with management to resolve them. Soon, the members of the Arts Society were selected by the student advisor and dean, forming a team of 25 members across 9 domains. Our first major task was organizing the odd semester cultural fest, Utopia. 🎭 /n  /n Utopia took place within a week of forming the Arts Society, spanning 3 days and featuring 25+ events, a movie night , stage performances, a DJ, and a music concert. On the first day, we were felicitated as members of SAAS CEG by our  Dean CEG Campus Dr. L Suganthi and Student Advisor CEG Campus Dr. Swaminathan . This was my first event, and I wholeheartedly contributed to its success. 🎶 /n  /n Next, we organized open calls for volunteers from various years. We started with the 3rd years, then the 2nd years, and finally welcomed the 1st years to SAAS. Each open call had its challenges, but we learned from our mistakes and improved each time. The last open call was our biggest success, with overwhelming support from the 1st years. 🚀 /n  /n Our next major goal was organizing the grand college cultural fest, Techofes🎭. Seeking sponsors was initially tough, with many rejections, but we persevered and secured the necessary sponsorships. I involved myself in all domains, mainly focusing on Marketing, Technical Design, Human Resources, Events, and Corporate Relations. 💼 /n  /n Techofes was packed with events, prize money, movie nights, DJ nights, T-awards, music concerts, T-rides, food stalls, sponsor stalls, workshops, and many more fun activities ✨.  /n  /n 🌟During the four days of Techofes, I worked with all domain office bearers 💼, helped with various tasks, and gave my best. I learned a lot, made tough decisions, faced challenging situations, and enjoyed every moment. 🎊🎶 /n  /n #Leadership #StudentLife #CEG #AnnaUniversity #SAAS #Teamwork #Dedication #Utopia #Techofes"

      "🚀 Exciting Announcement guys, a Data Engineering task conquered! 🎉 /n I've successfully completed a challenging data engineering task 🤘 , and here's what it entailed: /n - To collect movie details starting with the letters 'S' and 'H' from at least two websites. /n - Leveraged any language of choice to scrape data from diverse sources like Wikipedia, IMDb, and Rotten Tomatoes. /n - Utilized middle layer APIs found on the web for streamlined data retrieval. /n 🛠️ After crafting a schema tailored to store relevant movie details in a database of choice, I ensured scalability by populating the datastore with over 10,000 records. /n ✨ Data Pipeline Creation: Employed the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Python. /n - Extracted data seamlessly from the TMDB Movie API. /n - Transformed and enriched the data to suit the database schema. /n - Loaded the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database, meticulously designed by yours truly. /n 🌐 I also developed the Met-Movie-API, a Python Flask service that allows users to access all the enriched movie data stored in the PostgreSQL database. The seamless integration enables users to interact with the database effortlessly./n 📚 Throughout this journey, I've acquired valuable skills. I mastered the ETL model, gained expertise in creating APIs using Flask for seamless data access, implemented multiprocessing techniques in Python for enhanced performance, and containerized the entire application for easy deployment and scalability using Docker. /n 💼 I'm thrilled to invite you to explore the project on GitHub and contribute your insights and expertise. /n Let's collaborate and innovate together! /n GitHub Repo: https://lnkd.in/gXFf-8gX /n #DataEngineering #ETL #Python #FlaskAPI #PostgreSQL #Docker #DataPipeline #TMDB #MetMovieAPI #GitHub #Contribute #Collaborate #Innovate /n Feel free to engage with the project, share your thoughts, and join me in this journey of continuous learning and growth! 🚀🔍"
